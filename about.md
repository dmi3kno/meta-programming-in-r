This book gives an introduction to Meta-programming in the R programming language. Meta-programming is when you write programs manipulating other programs: you treat code as data that you can generate, analyse, or modify. R is a very high-level language where all operations are functions, and all functions are data that can be manipulated. There is great flexibility in how function calls and expressions are evaluated, and by exploiting this, we can create small domain-specific languages to extend R within the R language itself. In this book, you will learn how to manipulate functions and expressions to modify how the language interprets itself.

# Meta-programming programming in R

This is the source text to my book [*Meta-programming in R*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WD52ZXT/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B06WD52ZXT&linkCode=as2&tag=wpamazify-21&linkId=11f7851754895829ab09df08857d5c5e). If you want to support my writing, though, please consider buying the book at Amazon. This helps me recover the costs involved with writing and publishing books.

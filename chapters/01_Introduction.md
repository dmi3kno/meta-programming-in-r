# Introduction

Welcome to the *Advanced Statistical Programming in R* series and this book, *Meta-programming in R*. I am writing this series, and this book, to have teaching material beyond the typical introductory level most text books on R have. It covers some of the more advanced techniques used in R programming such as fully exploiting functional programming, writing meta-programs (programming the actual language structures), and writing domain specific languages to embed in R.

## About the series

The *Advanced Statistical Programming in R* series consists of short, single-topic books, where each book can be used alone for teaching or learning R. That said, there will, of course, be some dependencies in topics, if not in content, among the books. For instance, functional programming is essential to understand for any serious R programming and the first book in the series covers that. Reading the other books without understanding functional programming will not be fruitful. However, if you are already familiar with functional programming, then you can safely skip the first book.

For each book, I will make clear what I think the prerequisites for reading the book are, but for the entire series I will expect you to already be familiar with programming and the basic R you will see in any introductory book. None of the books will give you a tutorial introduction to the R programming language.

If you have used R before for data analysis and are familiar with writing expressions and functions, and want to take it further and write more advanced R code, then the series is for you.
